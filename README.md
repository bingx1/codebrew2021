# NFTr
A platform for University Clubs to issue NFTs. These may be Acheievments, Awards or Roles - anything.
## To-do
1. Write a better contract for the Base NFT 
    - **Requirements:**
    - Include a way to store which address gave the command to mint the NFT at run time
    - Give the NFT proper metadata (not the URI-based metadata)

2. Implement pre-rendering of pages via Next.js
3. Fix rendering of profile page to be dynamic instead of hard-coded
4. Use Ethers or Web3 API to list events emitted by the Users contract to show a list of users that have associated their wallet addresses with their Student IDs.
5. Explore how ENS names can be integrated into the app
6. Migrate all blockchain interaction to either Web3Alchemy or Ethers.io for consistency
7. Use metamask hook provided data in filling of forms, displaying profiles, etc.
